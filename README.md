# Workinator3 - Getting Started

This project contains scripts and (eventually) documentation on how to work with the other workinator 3 projects.

`stuff.py` was written using Pyton 3.6.

It iterates the workinator folders and executes various commands.

IE: `stuff status` executes `git status` in each directory.

Support commands
* pull
* commit
    * git add --all
    * git commit -m "TODO"
    * git push
* TODO: clone
